# Lock Removal Strategy

## Overview
Due to high cost of error creation and debugging related to mutex implementations, we are transitioning to a fully lock-free architecture. This document outlines the systematic approach to remove all mutex-based synchronization.

## Priority Areas

### 1. MIDI System (High Priority)
- Replace callback mutex with lock-free queue
- Expand use of lock-free queues for event processing
- Implement wait-free algorithms for device handling

### 2. Repository Layer (High Priority)
- Remove mutex from CachingScoreRepository
- Implement lock-free caching with atomic operations
- Use versioned data structures for concurrent access

### 3. Domain Layer (Medium Priority)
- Remove mutex from Score and Voice classes
- Implement copy-on-write semantics
- Use atomic operations for state changes

### 4. Testing Infrastructure (Low Priority)
- Remove LockTracker implementation
- Update test cases to focus on lock-free correctness
- Implement new concurrency tests

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MIDI System
1. Callback System
   - Replace callback mutex with lock-free queue
   - Implement atomic callback registration
   - Use event sourcing for state changes

2. Event Processing
   - Expand lock-free queue usage
   - Implement wait-free processing algorithms
   - Use atomic operations for state management

### Phase 2: Repository Layer
1. Cache Management
   - Remove cache mutex
   - Implement atomic cache updates
   - Use versioned cache entries

2. Concurrent Access
   - Implement lock-free read operations
   - Use atomic operations for writes
   - Add version control for consistency

### Phase 3: Domain Layer
1. State Management
   - Remove mutex from domain objects
   - Implement immutable state updates
   - Use atomic operations for changes

2. Event Handling
   - Remove event handler locks
   - Implement lock-free event propagation
   - Use atomic operations for ordering

## Success Criteria
- Zero mutex usage in codebase
- Maintained functional correctness
- Improved performance metrics
- No deadlocks or race conditions

## Monitoring
- Performance metrics before/after changes
- Error rate tracking
- System stability metrics
- Resource usage monitoring
