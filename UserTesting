## 14. Conclusion

This user testing document provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the MusicTrainer application from an end-user perspective. Initial testing has identified several critical issues that need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of note input, viewport navigation, and exercise integration. By focusing on the identified priorities and implementing the proposed resolutions, we can significantly improve the application's functionality and usability to better align with the requirements specified in the SRS.

Next testing iterations should focus on verifying the fixes for identified issues and evaluating newly implemented features to ensure they meet both functional requirements and usability standards. Continued user feedback will be essential to refine the application and provide a positive user experience for music students and educators.
