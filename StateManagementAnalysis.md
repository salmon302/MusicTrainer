# State Management Analysis

## 1. Current State Implementation Gaps

### 1.1 Thread Safety Concerns
```cpp
// Current implementation uses basic mutex
mutable std::mutex m_mutex;

// Need for more granular locking
struct StateGuards {
	std::shared_mutex scoreGuard;     // Read-write lock for score
	std::shared_mutex ruleSetGuard;   // Read-write lock for ruleset
	std::mutex listenerGuard;         // Mutex for listener management
};
```

### 1.2 Missing State Components
- No viewport state management
- No MIDI device state
- No exercise state persistence
- No undo/redo stack

### 1.3 State Synchronization Issues
- Potential race conditions in callback execution
- No guarantee of state consistency across components
- Missing transaction support for atomic operations

## 2. Required State Extensions

### 2.1 Viewport State
```cpp
struct ViewportState {
	struct ScoreViewport {
		Rectangle visibleArea;
		float zoomLevel;
		std::vector<VoiceId> visibleVoices;
	};
	
	struct PlaybackState {
		Position currentPosition;
		bool isPlaying;
		float tempo;
	};
};
```

### 2.2 Exercise State
```cpp
struct ExerciseState {
	ExerciseId currentExercise;
	std::vector<Solution> attempts;
	ProgressMetrics progress;
	ValidationState validation;
};
```

## 3. State Management Patterns

### 3.1 Command Pattern Implementation
```cpp
class StateCommand {
	virtual void execute() = 0;
	virtual void undo() = 0;
	virtual void redo() = 0;
	virtual bool isReversible() const = 0;
};

class StateManager {
	std::stack<StateCommand*> undoStack;
	std::stack<StateCommand*> redoStack;
	void executeCommand(StateCommand* cmd);
};
```

### 3.2 Event Sourcing
- Event logging for state changes
- State reconstruction from events
- Snapshot management
- Event replay capability

## 4. Critical Operations

### 4.1 Atomic Operations
- Score modifications
- Rule validations
- State transitions
- Plugin operations

### 4.2 Composite Operations
- Exercise generation and setup
- Solution validation and feedback
- State save/restore
- Undo/redo operations

## 5. Performance Considerations

### 5.1 Memory Management
- State snapshot optimization
- Event log pruning
- Cache invalidation
- Resource cleanup

### 5.2 Concurrency
- Reader-writer patterns
- Lock-free operations where possible
- Background processing
- Event batching

## 6. Integration Requirements

### 6.1 Plugin System Integration
- Plugin state isolation
- State sharing mechanisms
- Version compatibility
- State migration

### 6.2 UI Integration
- View model synchronization
- Real-time updates
- State change notifications
- Error handling

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 State Consistency Tests
- Concurrent operation tests
- State transition tests
- Recovery tests
- Performance benchmarks

### 7.2 Integration Tests
- Cross-component state sync
- Plugin state management
- UI state binding
- Event processing

## 8. Implementation Priorities

### 8.1 High Priority
1. Thread safety improvements
2. Viewport state management
3. Command pattern implementation
4. State consistency guarantees

### 8.2 Medium Priority
1. Event sourcing
2. Plugin state isolation
3. Performance optimizations
4. Testing infrastructure
