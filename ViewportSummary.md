# Viewport System Summary

## Overview
The viewport system manages the dynamic grid expansion and content visualization in MusicTrainerV2, providing efficient handling of large scores while maintaining optimal performance.

## Key Components

### 1. Grid Management
- Default grid size: One octave (12 semitones) vertical, viewport width horizontal
- Expansion triggers:
	- Vertical: Scroll to edge or note placement (6 semitone increments)
	- Horizontal: Scroll right or note placement (50% viewport width)
- Memory optimization through sparse storage and region-based loading

### 2. Performance Features
- Maximum latency: 10ms for MIDI input
- Target FPS: 60 for smooth scrolling
- Memory usage: Optimized through:
	- Viewport-based content loading
	- Region-based memory management
	- Cache invalidation strategies

### 3. Integration Points
- Score System:
	- Coordinate mapping between musical and screen space
	- Voice visualization and tracking
	- Note placement validation
- MIDI System:
	- Real-time input handling
	- Playback position tracking
	- Auto-scroll behavior

### 4. Technical Implementation
- Sparse matrix for grid storage
- Double-buffered rendering
- Lock-free MIDI queue
- Event-driven updates
- Background content loading

## Design Decisions

### 1. Expansion Strategy
- Progressive loading to maintain performance
- Configurable buffer zones for smooth experience
- Predictive loading based on user behavior
- Memory-aware unloading of distant regions

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Spatial indexing for note lookup
- Event batching for updates
- Coordinate transformation caching
- Asynchronous content loading

### 3. User Experience
- Smooth scrolling and zooming
- Responsive note input
- Clear visual feedback
- Consistent expansion behavior

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Performance Validation
- Input latency measurements
- Frame rate monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Load time analysis

### 2. Functional Testing
- Grid expansion behavior
- Content preservation
- MIDI integration
- State management
