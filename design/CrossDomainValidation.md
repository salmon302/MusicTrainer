# Cross-Domain Validation Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for cross-domain validation in the Music Trainer application. The goal is to ensure that rules and constraints defined in the domain model are consistently applied across all domains (music theory, MIDI processing, exercise generation, etc.).

## Design Considerations

1. **Consistency:** The validation process must ensure consistent application of rules across all domains.
2. **Performance:** The validation process should not significantly impact the application's real-time performance.
3. **Extensibility:** The design should allow for easy addition of new validation rules and domains.
4. **Maintainability:** The design should be easy to understand, maintain, and modify.

## Proposed Design

The proposed design uses a central validation pipeline that coordinates validation across different domains. Each domain will have its own set of validation rules, and the central pipeline will execute these rules in a defined order.

### Central Validation Pipeline

The central validation pipeline will be responsible for:
- Receiving the score to be validated.
- Determining the relevant domains for validation.
- Executing the validation rules for each domain.
- Aggregating the validation results.
- Returning a summary of the validation results.

### Domain-Specific Validation Rules

Each domain will have its own set of validation rules. These rules will be implemented as separate classes that conform to a common interface. The interface will define methods for:
- Initialization
- Validation
- Result reporting

### Rule Execution Order

The order in which validation rules are executed is crucial for ensuring correct validation results. The order will be defined in a configuration file that can be easily modified.

### Validation Result Aggregation

The central validation pipeline will aggregate the results from each domain-specific validation rule. The aggregated result will include a summary of all violations, warnings, and errors.

### Extensibility

New validation rules and domains can be added by creating new classes that conform to the common interface and updating the configuration file.

## Future Considerations

- Integration with a plugin system for extensibility.
- Implementation of a caching mechanism to improve performance.
- Development of more sophisticated reporting mechanisms.
